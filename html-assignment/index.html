    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm <em>Regina Trevino</em>, born on July 12, 2003, in <abbr title="Mexico City">CDMX</abbr>. Throughout my life, I was surrounded by dogs and numerous pets. I have an older brother named Sebastian, my best friend since day one, despite our 7-year age difference. My parents are divorced, a fact that doesn’t define my childhood but divided my time between two homes: my mom's house and my dad's house. At my mom's house, I discovered my passion for self-care and learned that biking is my preferred sport. Moreover, I realized that dogs are indeed my best companions. On the other hand, my time at my dad's house nurtured my creative side. I established my first clothing brand, mastering skills from sewing my own t-shirts to dyeing and ultimately teaching myself serigraphy. I also found joy in cooking at home and sharing the meals I prepared.</p>
    <p>With the tools my parents provided, I created the person I am today. The biking skills I obtained inspired me to become a triathlete<sup>1</sup>. I successfully completed a half ironman and continue to engage in sports at a healthy level. Learning to appreciate myself allowed me to appreciate others, leading to a fulfilling relationship. Through my boyfriend's influence, I developed a deep love for music and its creative process. This passion propelled me towards the music industry, where I now work with talented artists. Combining this newfound interest with my creative experiences at my dad's house, I decided to pursue studies in interactive media design, prompting a move to Ottawa.</p>
